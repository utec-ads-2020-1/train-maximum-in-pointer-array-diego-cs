int max(int *iptr[], int n);

This function returns the maximum integer pointed by the pointers in the array iptr. Note that each element in iptr is a pointer to an integer.

The main program is as follows.

#include <stdio.h>
#include "max.h"
 
int main() {
    int n, i;
    int array[100];
    int *iptr[100];
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &(array[(i + 3) % n]));
        iptr[i] = &(array[(i + 3) % n]);
    }
    printf("%d\n", max(iptr, n));
    return 0;
}
